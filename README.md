# Introduction
This project aims to collect and analyze climate data from the capitals of Spain from 1963 to 2022. The ultimate objective is to identify changes in weather patterns that could indicate global warming or other types of climate change.

I fetch data from public, free, and official sources. Data include essential information such as the name of the location, its latitude and longitude, and weather data for the years between 1963 to 2022. The analyzed weather variables include temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and snow. I have developed algorithms to transform and present the data in plots and animations over time. Finally, I analyze the existence of weather changes.
