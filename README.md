# 1. Introduction to Climate Change
According to NASA, climate change refers to alterations in the typical weather patterns observed in a particular location. Climate change has a global impact, affecting all regions of the world. Some of its effects include loss of sea ice, accelerated sea level rise, and temperature increase leading to more frequent heat waves.

The terms global warming and climate change are often used interchangeably, but it's important to note that global warming represents just one facet of the broader concept of climate change. Specifically, global warming is the long-term warming of the planet’s overall temperature.

Temperature anomalies play a crucial role in global warming studies as they indicate how temperature is changing over time. According to the National Centers for Environmental Information, temperature anomaly is the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for a specific location and date, serving as a measure of variation. It also serves as a vital tool to visualize the warming trend. Similarly, analyzing the anomaly of other weather parameters can help identify patterns and trends over time.

In this project, the focus is on analyzing climate change, particularly global warming, in Spain's capital cities.

# 2. Project objectives 
This project had three primary goals:

1. Collect climate data from the capital cities of Spain between 1963 and 2022.
2. Analyze the collected weather dataset.
3. Identify changes in weather patterns that could indicate global warming or other types of climate change.

# 3. The stages of the project
This text describes the project's development stages required to achieve its goals. First, data was fetched from public, free, and official sources including essential information such as location names, latitude and longitude, and weather data for the years between 1963 to 2022. The collected weather data consisted of temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and snow. Secondly, algorithms were developed to transform, analyze, and present the data in plots and animations over time. Lastly, climate changes were analyzed.
