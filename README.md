# 1. Introduction to Climate Change
According to NASA, climate change refers to alterations in the typical weather patterns observed in a particular location. Climate change has a global impact, affecting all regions of the world. Some of its effects include loss of sea ice, accelerated sea level rise, and temperature increase leading to more frequent heat waves.

The terms global warming and climate change are often used interchangeably, but it's important to note that global warming represents just one facet of the broader concept of climate change. Specifically, global warming is the long-term warming of the planet’s overall temperature.

Temperature anomalies play a crucial role in global warming studies as they indicate how temperature is changing over time. According to the National Centers for Environmental Information, temperature anomaly is the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for a specific location and date, serving as a measure of variation. It also serves as a vital tool to visualize the warming trend. Similarly, analyzing the anomaly of other weather parameters can help identify patterns and trends over time.

In this project, the focus is on analyzing climate change, particularly global warming, in Spain's capital cities.

# 2. Project objectives 
This project had three primary goals:

1. Collect climate data from the capital cities of Spain between 1963 and 2022.
2. Analyze the collected weather dataset.
3. Identify changes in weather patterns that could indicate global warming or other types of climate change.

# 3. The stages of the project OR RESUME
This text describes the project's development stages required to achieve its goals. First, data was fetched from public, free, and official sources including essential information such as location names, latitude and longitude, and weather data for the years between 1963 to 2022. Climatic data were obtained from Open-Meteo which is an open-source weather API and data about capital from Spaim were obtained from XXXXXXXXX. The collected weather data have a daily frequency and consist of temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and snow. Secondly, algorithms were developed to transform, analyze, and present the data in plots and animations over time. Lastly, climate changes were analyzed.

**Data on capital information.**

**Climatic data.**  The data were obtained from Open-Meteo which is an open-source weather API. was processed and the arithmetic mean was calculated for each year, and subsequently for each of the studied periods.

# 4. Results

**Temperature data.**

**Precipitation data.**

**Wind speed data.**

# 4. Conclusions

Findings from this study can be replicated and extended to the rest of the capital cities of Spain.

According to the results of the study, vulnerable areas in nature management were identified in the context of an increase in air temperature and a decrease in precipitation.

The monthly data was processed and the arithmetic mean was calculated for each year, and subsequently for each of the studied periods.

The average annual precipitation from 1961 to 2018 varied in the range from 12 mm to 59 mm per year (Fig. 6A). 

The total amount of precipitation (Fig. 4B) for the period from 1950 to 2000 has a range from 88 mm to 321 mm per year. The indicators that have fallen in the north-west (weather stations Kuigan, Aul 4, Bakanas) of the studied area represent a decrease in the total amount of precipitation from 120 to 150 to 100 mm (desert zone). In the mountainous areas of Almaty region, including in the east (weather stations Lepsinsk, Sarkand, Tekeli) and in the south (weather stations Kugaly, Mynzhylki, Almaty (OGMS and Kam. plateau), Ecic) there is an increase in the total amount of precipitation from 250 to 300–320 mm per year (mountain desert-steppe, mountain forest, alpine zones). The central part (Kapshagai, Aksenger, Karashok weather stations) has indicators of reduction from 170 to 200 to 88–100 mm per year (steppe, foothill, mountain-desert-steppe zones).

The maximum temperature (Fig. 5A) measured in the specified period varies from +11 °C to +27 °C. In the northern (weather stations Usharal, Matai, Naimansuyek), north-western (weather stations Kuigan, Aul 4, Bakanas) parts of the Almaty region, there is an increase in the maximum temperature from +22 °C to +27 °C (desert, semi-desert zones). In other parts of the region, the indicators are stable.

The minimum temperature indicators (Fig. 5B) measured in the period from 1950 to 2000 will change in the range from −8°C to −16 °C. According to meteorological data, in Almaty region, except the northern part of the region (weather stations Usharal, Matai, Naimansuyek), there is an increase in the minimum temperature (desert, semi-desert zones).
